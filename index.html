        petition.</a> Thanks.</p>
    <br />
    <p>We are calling on your support for a cycle path between Stoke Gabriel and Totnes.</p>
    <p>Stoke Gabriel lies just three miles from Totnes, yet there is no safe and traffic-free route for cyclists and
      walkers between the village and town.</p>
    <p>The A385 is fast and dangerous, forcing people into their vehicles.</p>
    <p>Every day many people travel to, commute and work in Totnes and beyond.</p>
    <p>A safe, traffic-free, direct cycle path would reduce congestion and air pollution levels. It could save many
      thousands of motor vehicle trips each year.</p>
    <p>It would encourage people of all ages and abilities to travel actively to work and for leisure, improving the
      health
      of local residents.</p>
    <p>It could also draw more tourism into the village with a path that is free of motorised vehicles.</p>
    <p>This petition aims to build local support for the scheme and persuade decision makers that we need the cycle
      path
      now!</p>
    <p>Please help make this happen by <a
        href="https://www.change.org/p/devon-county-council-cycle-path-between-stoke-gabriel-and-totnes"
        target="_blank">signing this
        petition
        now</a> and commenting on how it would benefit
      you.</p>
